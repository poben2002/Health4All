Health4All

INFO Capstone Winter 2025 project repo for group Health4All. 

**Project Description:**
	The Cancer Interactive Map is a web-based visualization tool designed to uncover correlations and patterns between cancer incidence and social determinants of health—such as income level, race, and age—in King County. By combining open health datasets with interactive map features, the platform empowers researchers, policymakers, and community members to identify vulnerable populations and explore health disparities geographically. The goal of this project is to promote data-informed decision-making and raise awareness about inequities in cancer outcomes across different communities.

The website has four pages:
- Home Page: Introduces our project
- Map Page: Hosts the interactive GIS tool that visualizes breast cancer incidence across King County
	Highlights:
	- Interactive map with color-coded regions
	- Tooltips and detailed statistics by area
- Resource Page: Connects users with real-world support services, linking external resources across multiple categories.	
	Sections:
	- Get Involved: Community opportunities and advocacy events
	- Make an Appointment: Local clinic directories and screening providers
	- Healthcare and Financial Support: Aid programs and insurance assistance
	- Learn More: Educational materials on breast cancer prevention and care
- About Page: Provides transparency around the project’s creation, including where the data comes from, who built the tool, and what drives the mission.
